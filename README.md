# Hands-On Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to my Machine Learning study repository! 🚀

This project documents my journey through the book *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"* 📘. Each day, I add new models and approaches as I progress, showcasing my understanding of key Machine Learning concepts and implementations.

## 📚 Current Models

### Supervised Learning

1. **MNIST Training**  
   - **Description**: Classification task using the MNIST dataset.
   - **Models**: KNeighborsClassifier.
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

2. **Softmax Regression**
  The model is designed to classify data into multiple classes, and the implementation uses only NumPy, without relying on Scikit-Learn. The goal is to understand and apply the concepts of gradient descent and softmax regression to solve a multi-class classification problem.
   - **Description**: Multi-class logistic regression model.
   - **Metrics**: Cross-Entropy Loss, Accuracy.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, One-Hot Encoding

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - **Description**: Linear and kernel-based SVMs for classification and regression tasks.
   - **Models**: LinearSVC, LinearSVR, SVC, SVR, RandomizedSearchCV, StandardScaler.
