# Hands-On Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to my Machine Learning study repository! üöÄ

This project documents my journey through the book *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"* üìò. Each day, I add new models and approaches as I progress, showcasing my understanding of key Machine Learning concepts and implementations.

## üìö Current Models

### Supervised Learning

1. **MNIST Training**  
   - **Description**: Classification task using the MNIST dataset.
   - **Models**: KNeighborsClassifier.
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

2. **Softmax Regression**
  The model is designed to classify data into multiple classes, and the implementation uses only NumPy, without relying on Scikit-Learn. The goal is to understand and apply the concepts of gradient descent and softmax regression to solve a multi-class classification problem.
   - **Description**: Multi-class logistic regression model.
   - **Metrics**: Cross-Entropy Loss, Accuracy.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, One-Hot Encoding

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - **Description**: Linear and kernel-based SVMs for classification and regression tasks.
   - **Models**: LinearSVC, LinearSVR, SVC, SVR, RandomizedSearchCV, StandardScaler.

4. **Decision Tree (Random Forest)**  
   - **Description**: Tree-based model for classification and regression tasks. Also, self maded Random Forest from Decision Tree.
   - **Models**: DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTree, GridSearchCV.

5. **StackingClassifier**
   - **Description**: Combining multiple models to improve performance.
   - **Models**: RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, SVC, StackingClassifier.

6. **Dimensional Reduction**
   - **Description**: Dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE.

7. **Unsupervised Learning techniques**
   - **Description**: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction, Anomaly detection, etc.
   - **Models**: KMeans, GaussianMixture.

8. **Perceptron**
   - **Description**: Basic neural network algorithm for binary classification.
   - **Key Features**: Linear decision boundary, online learning capability.
   - **Implementation**: Custom implementation using NumPy.

9. **MLP Classification**
   - **Description**: Multi-layer Perceptron for multi-class classification.
   - **Architecture**: Input layer, hidden layer(s), output layer with softmax activation.
   - **Training**: Backpropagation algorithm, gradient descent optimization.
